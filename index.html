                <h1>Key Concepts in AI</h1>
                <li>Machine Learning (ML): ML is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Algorithms improve their performance over time by analyzing patterns and adjusting their models.</li>
                <li>
                    Deep Learning: A specialized form of ML, deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data. It has revolutionized fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition
                </li>
                <li>
                    Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis are common NLP applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Computer Vision: Computer vision allows machines to interpret visual information from images or videos. Applications include facial recognition, object detection, and autonomous vehicles
